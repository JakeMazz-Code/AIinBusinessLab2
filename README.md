# AI in Business Lab 2

This project analyzes customer churn for a streaming service dataset. It provides:

- Automated descriptive analytics and executive report generation (`Existing.py`).
- Visualizations and risk scoring outputs stored in the `reports/` directory.
- A Streamlit dashboard (`dashboard.py`) for interactive exploration of high-risk customers and model diagnostics.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python Existing.py
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The generated markdown report, figures, and risk tables are saved under `reports/`.
